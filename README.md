* What your project is
    * When the pandemic hit, one of the biggest sustainable goals to the world was hit, this was goal 3: the Good Health & Wellbeing. It was to ensure healty lives & promote well-being for all ages
    * My project was an attempt to build a wellness app that focuses on exercises and dieting as fitness is an important health factor to boost physical and mental wellness.  
* Why you built it? Who is the intended user?
    * My targeted users are adults that want to have quick course sessions on diet reccomendations and exercises to follow daily
* What were the results of your Prototype Evaluation?
    * For my prototype evaluation, I tested for concept and usability on figma. I had 3 tests done and  everyone seemed to like the idea of the personalization of a name, and dedicated courses.
* What were the biggest challenges and victories during this process?
    * The biggest challeges would definitely be the beginning, to even get a simulation going. There were lots of trial and errors in downloading and manuvering gfiles, but the end result of having a live simulation was defintely the most rewarding as its something fun to visually play with. This whole process really encouraged me that making an app is possible from scratch!
* Do you have any feature that you want help on or would have added?
    * I would defintely want to give this app a re-design to be more appealing to the eye.
    * Iâ€™d like to addd more about mental topics like reducing stress, rediucing anxiety, increasing happiness, having better sleep, etc.
